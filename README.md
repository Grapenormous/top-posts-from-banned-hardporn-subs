# What is this?

Reddit banned a shitton of subreddits a few months ago (July 2020). Thousands, probably. There were many subreddits included from what we now call the HardPorn family. Wanna fap to the porn you like? Now you can check out these lists of links. Each file is a subreddit.

Want another subreddit included? Go to [issues](https://github.com/Grapenormous/top-posts-from-banned-hardporn-subs/issues) and post your suggestion. If I feel like it, I'll add it.
